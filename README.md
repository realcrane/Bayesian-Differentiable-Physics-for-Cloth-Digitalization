## Needed Compilers and Libraries

- GCC 9.5.0 (or MSVC 19.29.30139)
- CUDA 11.3
- Python 3.8.13
- PyTorch 1.12.1
- Kaolin 0.12.0
- Alglib 3.17.0
- Boost 1.75
- Eigen 3.3.9

## How to install

1. Install GCC and CUDA, and confirm their environment variables are set correctly.
2. Install Python (Recommond to use Anaconda).
3. Install Pytorch and Kaolin with following their official documentations.
4. Download Alglib, Boost, and Eigen to a diretory you like.
5. Change the Setup.py to make sure the paths are set correctly, i.e. INCLUDE_DIR.append(...).
6. Run `python setup.py install`.
7. Finally, you can confirm our simulator has been successfully installed by executing the following commonds in prompt:

```python
-> python
-> import pytorch
-> import diffsim
```
